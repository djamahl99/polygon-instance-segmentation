# Polygon Instance Segmentation

Experimenting with instance segmentation models with polygon prediction heads.

## PolyTransform

Attempting to implement the PolyTransform paper that achieves [highest AP on CityScapes](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/instance-segmentation-on-cityscapes).

Unfortunately the accompanying code for the paper has been taken down. The paper is worthy of being reimplemented as it predicts polygon vertex offsets rather than a dense pixel mask.

### Progress

- [x] ResNet FPN
- [x] Image Embedding
  - [x] CoordConv
  - [ ] Downsampling channels 256 -> 64
    - Kernel shape? 
- [x] Sampling with grid_sample
- [x] Transformer?
  - Influenced by ViT, without positional encoding (as added by CoordConv)
- [ ] Contour Algorithm
  - Would it be possible to use a CNN?

## Instance Segmentation Transformer

In future, want to adapt ISTR or similar transformer model with PolyTransform polygon head.
